# Readify

Readify's goal is to provide a common place for people to create booklists (book
playlists) based on factors such as genre, language, and author, to explore different books
that they could read online. The web application would provide book recommendations
based on users' choices of books and created playlists, all while utilizing the GoodReads
Best Books Ever dataset
